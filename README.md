# Inventory of prompt engineering learning resources

Remember throughout all of this learning the most fundamental point to keep front of mind is that LLMs only present you with the next most likely thing to say, not what is correct.  

Over time, the error rate of getting this prediction nearly correct will go down, but it will always depend on the underlying model, the dataset it was trained on, our ability to generate the correct prompt and then optimising the prompt to get the most correct answer.
